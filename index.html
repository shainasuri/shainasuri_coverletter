                Dear Rosalyn, 
                <br><br> 
                Thank you for taking the time to review my application to The Orchard. It was a pleasure to find this opportunity for young creatives, like myself, looking to do spirited work in their careers.

                <p>about me</p>
                I am a senior at Parsons School of Design, majoring in Communication Design with a minor in Photography. Currently, I am working at Spring Studios in New York, in Marketing and Business Development. My goal is to work in the roles of Creative Director, and eventually Chief Creative Officer, as this would amalgamate my aptitude for creativity, strategic thinking, and leadership.

                <p>my experience</p>
                During my undergraduate studies for the past 3 years, I have completed multiple internships and conducted independent projects simultaneously. As a result of which, I have developed the ability to manage multiple projects with large deliverables and short deadlines - while maintaining a standard of delivering high quality work. I have the privilege of studying at a school where I am surrounded by creativity, and have the opportunity to grow with individuals who are able to reflect our world in unique ways. Additionally, I have the chance to work at a dynamic company, where I work on developing their internal and external value propositions through a creative lens. The most recent responsibility I had included writing and developing the overall marketing plan, as the company tries to reposition itself to enter new spheres of industry. My ability to strategize and design allowed me to pitch ideas that will take tangible form in the upcoming months.
