                Dear Reader, 
                <br><br> 
                If you have found this microsite, I welcome you to peruse this cover letter for my application to The Orchard. 
                It was a pleasure to find this opportunity for young creatives, like myself, looking to do spirited work in their careers.

                I am a senior at Parsons School of Design, majoring in Communication Design with a minor in Photography. Currently, I am working at Spring Studios in New York, in Marketing and Business Development. My goal is to work in the roles of Creative Director, and eventually Chief Creative Officer, as this would amalgamate my aptitude for creativity, strategic thinking, and leadership.

                <!-- <p>my experience</p> -->
                During my undergraduate studies for the past 3 years, I have completed multiple internships and conducted independent projects simultaneously. As a result of which, I have developed the ability to manage multiple projects with large deliverables and short deadlines - while maintaining a standard of delivering high quality work. I have the privilege of studying at a school where I am surrounded by creativity, and have the opportunity to grow with individuals who are able to reflect our world in unique ways. Additionally, I have the chance to work at a dynamic company, where I work on developing their internal and external value propositions through a creative lens. The most recent responsibility I had included writing and developing the overall marketing plan, as the company tries to reposition itself to enter new spheres of industry. My ability to ideate, strategize, and design allowed me to pitch ideas that will take tangible form in the upcoming months.

                As an active learner, I am always curious and eager to understand and absorb new disciplines in order to provide a fresh perspective to any conversation. After learning about design, art, and photography in my classes, I go home or to my office to read books on entrepreneurship and business to understand how I can bring these two worlds together.

                <!-- <p>my experience</p> -->
                Based on this mode of thinking, I am developing a thesis project titled: ‘CMYK’. Inspired by the CMYK inks & printing process, the name signifies its four core pillars including Connections, Marketing, Youth, and Knowledge. It is an original generative design identity, meant to evolve and develop in a visual and conceptual sense. It comes to life in the form of an event series,  hosted at Parsons School of Design, connecting the bright minds of the future with established figures in the creative industry to generate ideas, collaboration, and innovation.

                It is a way for me as a young professional to tap into my evolving network, that I have been curating over the past few years; to aid the development of my peers as we start to establish ourselves in the world. I thoroughly enjoy making connections, whether that is amongst people, cultures, places, businesses, or just ideas. At this point in time, in our saturated visual culture, the best ideas are formed at the interstice of collaboration between multiple identities.

                This is the foundation of what I would bring to Apple, and am anticipating the prospect of cultivating my creative thinking and potential, alongside established professionals. I maintain the notion that creativity is knowledge personified, and my role is to endure the riveting journey that translates it into a form that the world can engage with. Since this program is at the nexus of my experience and interests, I believe I am a qualified candidate to participate and take this forward in an innovative environment.
